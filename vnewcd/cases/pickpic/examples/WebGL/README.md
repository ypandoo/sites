# WebGL Examples

These examples are specific to the new WebGL public preview for EaselJS. These demos must all be run from a server, and are dependent on the ../../libs and ../assets directory.

## Runners

Example showing SpriteStage, SpriteContainer, Sprite, BitmapText, and Bitmap in use in WebGL. Also shows the use of vector hit areas, and using the SpriteStage.isWebGL property to scale content when WebGL is not supported.

## TwoStages

Demonstrates the use of Stage.nextStage to seamlessly pass mouse (and touch) interactions from a Context2D Stage to a WebGL SpriteStage layered beneath it.
